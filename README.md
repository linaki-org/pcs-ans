Pcs-ans is a point and click game engine originally created for a game called A Noside Story (a copy of a famous role player game, but no ad in this README ðŸ˜„).
The first game ever created with this wonderful tool was **Bad Tentacles**, the second part of the mythic point and click game **Day of the Tentacle**.
